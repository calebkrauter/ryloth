# ryloth

2D platformer game

## Background

### How did you decide to start this project?

I decided to start project ryloth as an introductory project into game development because I want to tell stories through writing code in complex video games.

### Why do you want to deliver this project?

Project ryloth is a game that I decided to start building with the intention of learning a professional workflow, skills and experience to create a strong foundation so that I can create more complex games.

### Any other interesting context for this project?

Some of the knowledge and tools that I will use in this project is from a Java-based course that I took called Programming Practicum.

### Why have you named it the way you did

The theme I have chosen for project codenames is Star Wars planets. [Ryloth](https://www.starwars.com/databank/ryloth) is a planet in Star Wars.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a 2D platformer game. For this game to be considered complete it should include the following; characters, animated movement, physics for jump, attack, charaters must have health, main menu, pause feature, at least a single level/map with the ability to add more, a goal, and it must be playtested by at least one other person than the developer.

## What are some key milestones or takeaways that you wish to accomplish?

-   Game has characters
    -   Characters animate via spritesheets
    -   Enemies are bots
-   Game has laws of physics
    -   Gravity, ability to jump/fall
    -   Air resistance, How bullets/arrows fly
-   Game has goals and acheivments
    -   How to win the game?
    -   User killed 100 enemies
    -   User killed big boss
    -   XP / level up, weapon rank
-   Game can be saved
    -   Games can be paused, saved, exited and then resumed
-   Game has audio

## Tenets

_Tenets help you make decisions_

-   Document always–Track your work in issues and communicate decisions and ramp-up via READMEs.
-   Keep things simple–Code should be well organized and readable.
-   Flexibilty–Keep things extensible so when requirements inevitably change, it is easy to adjust.
-   Performance–Be aware of the efficiency of your code and consider how it scales.

## Roadmap

### In a perfect world, what would happen with this project?

In a perfect world project ryloth will be complete with multiple levels, character animation, personally-made custom music and copy-right free or personally-made custom-sound fx, personally-made custom art for map designs and charater desgins, short-term and long-term player goals, playtesters have fun playing and is listed on the Steam store for free or for sale.

## Requirements

Discuss some key requirements or limitations (sort of like, specific goals)

-   Language: Java
-   Will not use a game engine
-   Supported OS: MacOS, Windows (Linux? Web? Mobile?)
