# ryloth
## 2D platformer game

## **How did you decide to start this project?**
##### I decided to start project ryloth as an introductory project into game development because I want to tell stories through writing code in complex video games.

## **Why do you want to deliver this project?**
##### Project ryloth is a game that I decided to start building with the intention of learning a professional workflow, skills and experience to create a strong foundation so that I can create more complex games.

## **Any other interesting context for this project?**
##### Some of the knowledge and tools that I will use in this project is from a Java-based course that I took called Programming Practicum.

## **Why have you named it the way you did?**
##### The theme I have chosen for project codenames is Star Wars planets. [Ryloth](https://www.starwars.com/databank/ryloth) is a planet in Star Wars.

## **Goal**
##### The goal of this project is to create a 2D platformer game. For this game to be considered complete it should include the following; characters, animated movement, physics for jump, attack, charaters must have health, main menu, pause feature, at least a single level/map with the ability to add more, a goal, and it must be playtested by at least one other person than the developer.

## **What are some key milestones or takeaways that you wish to accomplish?**
##### - Animate chracters using spritesheets.
##### - Implement enemies with corisponding AI.
##### - Implement game physics.
##### - Implement in-game goal.
##### - Implement audio.
##### - Implement good code design for writing levels/maps.

## **In a perfect world, what would happen with this project?**
##### In a perfect world project ryloth will be complete with multiple levels, character animation, personally-made custom music and copy-right free or personally-made custom-sound fx, personally-made custom art for map designs and charater desgins, short-term and long-term player goals, playtesters have fun playing and is listed on the Steam store for free or for sale.

## **Requirements**
##### Discuss some key requirements or limitations (sort of like, specific goals)
##### - Write game using Java.
##### - May not use game engine.
##### - Document project issues and progress on Github.
